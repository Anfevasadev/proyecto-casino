/*
  This file defines the root component of the React application. It should set up
  React Router for navigation between pages. Import BrowserRouter, Routes,
  Route, and Navigate from react-router-dom. Define three routes:
    - "/" that redirects to "/login".
    - "/login" that renders the Login page component.
    - "/casinos" that renders the Casinos page component.

  You should import the Login and Casinos components from the pages folder.
  Use <BrowserRouter> to wrap the <Routes>. Use <Navigate> with the 'replace'
  prop to redirect from "/" to "/login". Export this component as default.

  The actual implementation is intentionally omitted here. These comments
  serve as guidance for future developers to reconstruct the routing logic.

// TODO: implement App component according to the instructions above.
