/*
  This component represents a single casino card used in the list of casinos.
  It should receive casino details as props (such as id, name, address or
  description) and render them in a simple card layout using Tailwind CSS
  classes for styling.

  The card should include:
    - The name of the casino as a heading.
    - Additional details such as the city or address if available.
  Make sure to choose semantic HTML elements (e.g., <div>, <h3>, <p>). This
  component will be used by the Casinos page to display each casino in a
  collection.

  The actual JSX implementation has been intentionally left out. Use these
  instructions as a blueprint for your implementation.

// TODO: implement CasinoCard component according to the instructions above.
